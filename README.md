# rospy_turtlebot

I had the opportunity to work with a [Turtlebot Waffle-Pi](https://www.roscomponents.com/en/mobile-robots/215-turtlebot-3-waffle.html#/courses-no/turtlebot3_waffle_pi_model-waffle_pi) in a school lab and program it to perform various tasks. The labs were focused on pose control, path following, and Kalman Filtering. Combining those three concepts, the final culminating task was to program the Turtlebot to perform mail delivery.

The scripts are orgnized into the separate labs that they were a part of. Please read the documentation for each lab to udnerstand each task and how it was implemented.

The Turtlebots run ROS 1, and the rospy module in Python was used to direct the robots. All scripts in the repository are in Python 3.
